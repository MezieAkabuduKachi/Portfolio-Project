# Creating-A-Database
Hello and welcome to my data analysis portfolio project! In this project,
I created a database using SQL to manage and analyze a large dataset on Sales of a SuperMarkret. 
The dataset used in this project was obtained from a real-world scenario
and it required significant cleaning and transformation to be usable in the database.
Throughout the project, I utilized various SQL techniques, such as creating tables, inserting data, and querying the data.
I also implemented various advanced SQL concepts like joining tables, using subqueries, and creating views in further repostories.
The final result is a well-structured and optimized database that can be used for various analyses and business intelligence tasks.
I hope you find this project informative and insightful. Thank you for taking the time to review my work.

# Data-Exploration
Hello and welcome to my data analysis portfolio project! In this project,
I leveraged my SQL skills to perform data exploration and analysis on a database that I previously created. 
I utilized various statistical techniques and visualizations to gain insights into the data and draw meaningful conclusions. 
The project report provides a detailed explanation of my approach and findings. 
 
 # More-on-Data-Exploration
Welcome back to my data analysis portfolio project! In this project,
I continued my exploration and analysis of the SQL database that I created earlier. 
I dug deeper into the data using advanced statistical techniques to gain more insights and make predictions. 
The project report provides a comprehensive overview of my approach, results, and recommendations. 
I hope you find this project informative and insightful!

# Data-Cleaning (In this exercise i cleaned Nashville Housing Data i got from the web in MySQL.)
Welcome to my data analysis portfolio project! In this project,
I focused on data cleaning and preparation using the Nashville Housing dataset obtained from the web. 
The data required significant cleaning and transformation to be usable in MySQL,
and I utilized various data cleaning techniques such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and dealing with outliers.
I also implemented data normalization techniques to optimize the database structure and improve its efficiency.
The project report provides detailed documentation on the cleaning and transformation process and how I utilized MySQL to achieve my objectives.
